Etch-a-Sketch is a tangible interface allowing anyone to playfully explore and control a 3D printerâ€™s hardware. The interface enables users to guide the X and Y axes, extrude filament, and increment the Z axis, all without a software controller. The interface lays a foundation for future work around play, technology, and digital fabrication; educational design around machine control; and alternative interfaces for digital fabrication.
